# 8-bit_priority_encoder_vnr
Initial Report_SSCS Contest

Abstract:-
A priority encoder is a circuit that compresses multiple binary(2n) inputs into a
smaller number of (n) outputs based on priority.If two or more inputs are high
at the same time, the input having the highest priority will take precedence.It
takes 8 bits as input,and gives back 3 bits as output based on priority.Priority
encoder was designed with conventional CMOS technique,because operational
speed is high,noise is low,better thermal stability and low power consumption
as compared to FET,BJT.Encoders are good at compressing data. However,
the problem with binary encoders is that if more than one of the input bits is
high, then it produces an error at the output. Whereas priority encoders were
made to overcome this issue. It gives an output by considering only the highest
priority bit.
